# Diabetes-Prediction_ML_Project
This project predicts diabetes using machine learning and the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset. Through detailed analysis, preprocessing, and models like Logistic Regression and AdaBoost, we achieved 86% accuracy. Key factors, such as BMI and blood pressure, emphasize the power of data-driven early detection and prevention.
